## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [matias.pierobonm@gmail.com](mailto:matias.pierobonm@gmail.com).

### Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:
- Experience level (from first-time contributors to veteran developers)
- Background, identity, or personal characteristics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- `zsh` or `bash` installed
- Git
- A GitHub account
- Basic familiarity with Git and GitHub workflow
- (Optional) Experience with dotfiles and bash-scripting is helpful but not required!

### First Contributions

Not sure where to start? Look for issues labeled:
- `good first issue` - Simple tasks perfect for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Tasks where we need community assistance
- `documentation` - Help improve our docs (no coding required!)
- `apps` - request integration for some app's config

## How Can I Contribute?

### üêõ Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates. When creating a bug report, include:

```markdown
**Description**
A clear and concise description of the bug.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Run the `app/install.sh` '...'
2. Apply changes '...'
4. See error

**Expected Behavior**
What you expected to happen.

**Actual Behavior**
What actually happened, including any error messages.

**System Information**
- OS: [e.g., Ubuntu 22.04]
- Python version: [e.g., 3.10.5]
- Enabled apps: [e.g., bat, act]


**Additional Context**
Add any other context, including references if applicable.
```

### üí° Suggesting new App configs

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, include:

- **Use case**: Explain the problem you're trying to solve
- **Proposed solution**: Describe how you envision it working
- **Alternatives considered**: List any alternative solutions you've thought about
- **Application context**: If relevant, explain how you would commonly use this app for

### üìö Adding Platform Support

Want to add support for a new Operating System? Here's how:

1. **Create an issue** discussing the system you want to add
2. **Gather resources**: Ensure you have legal access to the resources
3. **Start with core package-managment**: Focus on app installation first
4. **Follow the pattern**: Look at existing implementations
5. **Add config compatiblity**: Every app needs config, let's create a single config file

### üé® Improving the UI/UX

- Mockups and design suggestions are welcome!
- Consider accessibility in all designs
- CLI arguments should be intuitive, tell us if you find them confusing.

## Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kerbaras/dotfiles.git
```

### 2. Set Up Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run hooks manually (optional)
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 3. Run a particular installer

```bash
# Start the development server
./configs/git/install.sh

# Or use the development script
./scripts/dev.sh  # On Windows: scripts\dev.bat
```

## File Organization

```
